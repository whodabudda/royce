# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        The Internet is crowded with opinion,  much of it unsupportable by fact.  The Whodabudda 
        blog attempts to be a place where opinion is welcome and is documented with references to
        facts and figures that give the opinion credibility.

       desc: >
        Administrators can create Articles without prior review.  They can review comments and assign a 
        status to those comments.  Administrators essentially control the quality of site content.  As such,
        anyone who wants to be an admin of this site will go through a vetting process.   If you are interested,
        please send an email to whodabudda@gmail.com to start the process.
