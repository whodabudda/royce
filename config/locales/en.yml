# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        Not much to tell, really.


        You can browse the pictures.  If there are multiple galleries and you want to hide one, 
        use the filter menu on the navigation bar.  Click on one of the images to see it enlarged
        and to view additional attributes such as name or description, that may have been added by the artist.


        The little boxes next to the gallery name are for re-sizing that galleries images.  The box with
        4 squares means larger images, the one with 12 squares means smaller images.  If the size no longer
        changes when you click the box, then you have reached the limit for resizing in that 
        particular direction.


        We havn't added a print menu to format greeting cards, postcards etc.,  but may consider
        doing so if enough people request it.


        More images will be added as time passes because Nancy is very productive and loves to share.
